## OpenBMC - An Open Framework of Embedded Linux In Server Management

OpenBMC is an open-source project supported by LINUX Foundation. It's originated from Facebook's hackthon event in 2014, which aims to create an open infrastructure for BMC firmware development. Unlike the traditional BMC LINUX solutions have lots of proprietary codes, openBMC can be a standard and all designs or changes must be reviewed based on common principles, which enhance  reliability and compatibity of firmware with other systems or services.

Since there are more and more cloud providers participate in OpenBMC development, it's a good chance to talk about this new framework and how it would affect server management in the future.
